## JavaScript is so much more than your favorite framework!

This is a repo that showcases how to use vanilla JS to build
a simple note-taking web application with features like:
- Client-side routing
- State management
- Persistent storage
- Inter-component communication
- Responsive design
- Toast notifications
- JSX syntax without React

The goal is to demonstrate that you don't need a heavy framework
to build interactive web apps. Modern JavaScript and the DOM API provide all the tools you need to create rich user experiences without the overhead of a full-fledged framework.

This also serves as an educational resource for understanding how frameworks like React work under the hood by implementing similar features from scratch.

Should you not use a framework though? You probably should
because they are battle tested, have huge ecosystems, and
great developer tools. But if you want to learn more about
JavaScript, and what it can do, this is a fun way to explore that!
